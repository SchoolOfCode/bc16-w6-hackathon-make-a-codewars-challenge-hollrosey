✨ Hackathon 6 - Build your own Codewars kata

# 📜 Mystery Cipher

## 📖 Story

In the depths of a mysterious forest, you have uncovered an ancient tablet, it's contents obscured by a cryptic ciper. Legends spoke of a hidden code that held the key to unlocking secrets untold.

As a brave adventurer, it falls to you to decipher this cryptic tablet and reveal the message hidden upon it.

Good luck!

## 💭 Reflections

What went well:

- Getting to 300 honour on Codewars
- Thorough brainstorming and planning
- Talking through our projects together as a group for ideas and support
- Hitting MVP targets and being able to work on stretch goals

Where I could improve:

- Don't panic when something isn't working as expected, take a break and try again or ask my team to look with me
- Take more breaks, it's harder to enforce when working alone
- Increase the complexity of the initial kata

## 📝 Plan

🏁 Setup:

1. Use Disney Ideation to brainstorm some kata ideas ✅
2. Decide on a kata to create that fits in the hackathon time constraints ✅
3. Break this idea down into an MVP and add suitable stretch goals ✅
   🛠️ MVP:
4. Define a cipher text variable and create a key
5. Create a function skeleton in 'main.js' file ✅
6. Write a plan for the code in comments within the skeleton function ✅
7. Write tests based on these comments first ✅
8. Go back and implement code to pass these tests- starting in the simplest form and making changes accordingly ✅
9. Check that tests are working correctly with the solution to the kata ✅
10. Remove solution code once tests are working ✅
11. Push working tests with skeleton function
    🚀 Stretch Goals:
12. Handle different cases
13. Publish to Codewars
14. Make harder versions of the kata to publish so that it addresses different skillsets
15. Translate it into languages other than JavaScript

### Desicions table testing

| Test Case | Cipher Text    | Expected Outcome |
| --------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| 1         | "pwvvc"        | "hello"          |
| 2         | "pwvvc rclvm!" | "hello world!"   |
| 3         | "?!"           | "?!"             |
| 4         | "123"          | "123"            |

### 🧠 Brainstorming

🏰 Disney Ideation:

🌟 The Dreamer

- A cryptographic challenge with cyphers
- Pixel art generator that can be scaled to different kyu
- Noughts and crosses game, Connect Four, chess or Go
- Puzzle solving like escape rooms and puzzle games
- Ensure kata is fun and engaging

🤔 The Realist

- Cryptographic challenges may need to be simplified within time constraint
- Pixel art may be difficult for some people to visualise
- Games with complicated rules would also take up a lot of planning time (e.g. escape rooms, chess etc)
- Keep in mind the time constraint and how complex the challenge is

🕵️‍♂️ The Critic

- Limited to my own understanding so can't create katas that are very complex
- Above point rules out advanced mathematical and scientific challenges (e.g. Fibonacci Spirals idea)
- I must be able to understand the kata inside and out in order to create it
