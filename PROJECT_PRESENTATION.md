# ✨ Hackathon 6 - Build your own Codewars kata

## 📖 Story

In this kata, you will be thrown into the world of algorithmic artistry and be tasked to create your own pixel art generator.

Your task is to implement 'generatePixelArt', a function that generates pixel art images based on provided specifications. Every pixel within the image will be represented by a colour value chosen from a predetermined palette.

Where I could improve:

## 📝 Plan

🏁 Setup:
1. Use Disney Ideation to brainstorm some kata ideas
2. Decide on a kata to create that fits in the hackathon time constraints
3. Break this idea down into an MVP and add suitable stretch goals

🛠️ MVP: 
4. Create a function skeleton in 'main.js' file 
5. Write a plan for the code in comments within the skeleton function 
6. Write tests based on these comments first 
7. Go back and implement code to pass these tests- starting in the simplest form and making changes accordingly 
8. Check that tests are working correctly with the solution to the kata 
9. Remove solution code once tests are working 
10. Push working tests with skeleton function

🚀 Stretch Goals: 
11. Publish to Codewars 
12. Make harder versions of the kata to publish so that it addresses different skillsets 
13. Translate it into languages other than JavaScript


### Brainstorming

🏰 Disney Ideation

🌟 The Dreamer

- A cryptographic challenge with cyphers
- Pixel art generator that can be scaled to different kyu
- Noughts and crosses game, Connect Four, chess or Go
- Puzzle solving like escape rooms and puzzle games
- Ensure kata is fun and engaging

🤔 The Realist

- Cryptographic challenges may need to be simplified within time constraint
- Pixel art may be difficult for some people to visualise
- Games with complicated rules would also take up a lot of planning time (e.g. escape rooms, chess etc)
- Keep in mind the time constraint and how complex the challenge is

🕵️‍♂️ The Critic

- Limited to my own understanding so can't create katas that are very complex
- Above point rules out advanced mathematical and scientific challenges (e.g. Fibonacci Spirals idea)
- I must be able to understand the kata inside and out in order to create it
